## Introduction

Nothing makes me happier than to take a powerful administrative tool, like PowerShell, and completely misuse it for the purposes of entertainment.

You've decided to run a lemonade stand on each Saturday of the Summer.

Purchase your inventory of cups, lemons and sugar from the grocery store.

Price your lemonade based on the cost of ingredients, weather forecast, etc.

Lowering your prices will sell more lemonade but return less on each sale.

You might be able to sell more lemonade on hot days at higher prices.

Try to maximize your profits before the Summer ends.

Currency units are selected based on the current computer locale.
